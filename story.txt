Once upon a time, there was a dog named Bagel. 
Bagel was out for a walk one night with her owner. 
Suddenly the sun started to set and Bagel started whimpering. 
The sun slowly started creeping down the horizon and the road became 
darker and darker. There was one thing Bagel was scared of:the dark.

Alas, no need to fear, surely the street lights will turn on soon... right?
The daylight continued to vanish, and the street lights remained off.
Bagel's owner could sense her fear of the dark.
They were still 15 min away from home. 

"Jesus, why the street light happens to went wrong today!" Bagel's owner cried,
he was told not to let dark comes to Bagel as the consequence would be
unimaginable. Bagel's owner worked overtime at his company that day, and that 
was the first and the only time he walked Bagel at night.
