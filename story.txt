Once upon a time, there was a dog named Bagel. 
Bagel was out for a walk one night with her owner. 
Suddenly the sun started to set and Bagel started whimpering. 
The sun slowly started creeping down the horizon and the road became 
darker and darker. There was one thing Bagel was scared of:the dark.

Alas, no need to fear, surely the street lights will turn on soon... right?
The daylight continued to vanish, and the street lights remained off.
Bagel's owner could sense her fear of the dark.
They were still 15 min away from home.
